*Yonder* (noun): **"the far distance"** - *Oxford Dictionary*

Yonder is an AI assistant application i'm building using Jetpack Compose. It aims to provide users with a personalized and proactive assistant experience by utilizing contextual data and real-time information.

I intend for it to be an application which will allow users to give personal context such as their metadata, likes and dislikes, current location, current events, time of day etc to give better responses.


In time I have many ideas and *branches* for this such as making the assistant pro active, proccessing real-time data to instead push personalised questions prompting the user themselves for responses based on current and changing information.
